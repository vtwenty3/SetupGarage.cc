### About
Setup Garage is web-platform for uploading and downloading car setups for the sim-racing title
Asetto Corsa Competizione. Its target audience is sim-racing enthusiasts and people who want to learn more about race craft, car mechanics and car setups. 
Check out our Guides page where you can learn more about it!

The main functionality of the website is to serve as a file-sharing platform, which hosts setups for a different car and track combinations. If you select the car and track combination which has a setup uploaded, you will be redirected to a table with a title, description and a download button, where you can download the setup and use it in your simulator.  

### Development and Deployment
The website is hosted on a VPS Linux server using Flask, Nginx and Gunicorn.

### In progress
The project is still in its early stages and it is far from ready for a wider audience. There are a few key features planned before scaling it up and promoting it to sim-racing forms and communities.
